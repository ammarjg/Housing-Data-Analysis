# Housing Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of a housing dataset using R. The project covers various stages of data science including data understanding, exploration, manipulation, and visualization using the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages in R. 

## Project Structure
- **Housing.csv:** The dataset used for this analysis.
- **Housing_analysis.Rmd:** The R Markdown file containing the analysis.
- **Housing_analysis.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook (coming soon) version of the analysis with explanations and visualizations.
- **README.md:** This file, describing the project.

## Features
- Data understanding and summary statistics
- Data manipulation using `dplyr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
- Combined dplyr and ggplot2 for complex visualizations

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a housing dataset, which contains various features related to housing prices. The analysis explores relationships between features and performs visualizations to highlight key trends.

## Code Overview
The code performs the following steps:
1. **Data Import:** Load the housing dataset into R.
2. **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset by summarizing its structure, number of observations, and types of variables.
3. **Data Analysis:** Generate summary statistics for the numerical variables.
4. **Data Manipulation:** Perform various data manipulations using `dplyr`, such as filtering, grouping, and arranging the dataset.
5. **Data Visualization:** Visualize data relationships using `ggplot2` with histograms, scatter plots, and bar plots.
6. **Combining dplyr and ggplot2:** Create complex visualizations after data preprocessing with `dplyr`.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository: 
git clone https://github.com/amamrjg/Housing-Data-Analysis.git
2. Open the Rmd file or the IPYNB file for step-by-step code and explanations.
3. Install the necessary packages in R:
```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
